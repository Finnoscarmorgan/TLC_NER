- Hitherto, in drafting legislation, the language used has been of such a technical character that even legal men have been unable to understand it. How is it possible, when men educated in the technicalities of legal language are unable to understand it, for the common people who are supposed to obey the laws to understand them? I trust the Government will see that the new laws they propose will be framed in language that will be sufficiently clear and explicit, so that he who runs may read, and not be couched in terms of such a highly technical character that the Judges of the FederalSupreme Court will not be able to understand them. It has been said - I do not know to what extent it may be true - that parliamentary draftsmen are something like poets, "" born, not made."" If that be true, I hope that the head of the Government will discover a born parliamentary draftsman to frame the legislation of federated Australia. Whether he be born or made, I hope he will so perform his work that the people of Australia may be able to comprehend the laws which Parliament makes. ", ' ',G OVERNOR - GENERAL'S SPEECH

- I am glad that it is so. It is one of those points in the Government policy with which I heartily agree, and it is an experiment that possibly in the next generation will satisfy the ideas of those who are very eager for the State to have the increased values of property. The principle of land values assessment has been one of the hobbies of a large section of the people of Australia for some time past. This will give us an absolute chance of trying the experiment in a thorough manner, without interfering with any vested rights. The honorable member who has just resumed his seat alluded to the desire of some honorable members to alter the Constitution in order to remove the restriction as to the site of the federal capital. I think many honorable members will agree with me that when the compromise was arrived at by which it was agreed that the site of the federal capital should be in New South Wales-, not less than 100 miles from Sydney, it was a very great strain on many true federalists throughout Australia to fight for the Bill in that altered form. It was a most unfair and impropercompromise. Never theless it was made, and those who cared more for federation than for any point as to the site of the capital, fought just as loyally, although a little sorely, for the Federal Bill in its amended form, asthey had done before. Now that it is done with, a suggestion to alter the Constitution, in order to go back upon a bargain which was distinctly made, and which was distinctly approved of by the people of the Commonwealth, should certainly not receive much supportineither House of theParliament. I do not intend on private members' day to drag out this debate one moment more than is necessary. The amendment proposed by the Prime Minister is one which my honorable friend and erstwhile colleague in the State of South. Australia can very reasonably accept. It meets his wishes to a very large extent, and it carries out. the main points which he desires to see carried out. Of course, when he says that he thinks some site in Tasmania should, have been chosen as the very right proper, site - as the most beautiful and picturesque sitefor the federal capital, his opinion seems to have changed during the. last year or two. I have a rather vivid recollection that within the last ten yearsPort Victor, or some place of that kind, was once suggested by the honorable member with poetic ardour and eloquence - such as- he has displayed to-day in favour of Tasmania. Nevertheless, I commend to him the desirableness of accepting the amendment which, I think, will meet with the general support of honorable members.

- At important strategic points. I know that it may be argued that in the event of an enemy capturing our fortifications they could be used against us, but to prevent that we should make them secure and impregnable. No doubt in modern defensive warfare the artillery service is the arm which should have precedence, and in the administration of which the largest amount of skill is required. But, not only should we trust to the skill and training of our soldiers ; we should also lay the chemist's laboratory under tribute to supply us with the means of defence. Our artillery should be of the best and highest order, to be used purely for defensive purposes - not field artillery, but stationary well - defended armaments. Another important matter is the establishment of efficient army service and medical corps. In the present and in former wars, the greatest waste of life has been due to insufficient attention to the wounded and injured. We waste an enormous number of lives in time of war, because of our  primitive methods of dealing with our sick and wounded. It was stated that the French army would have lost thousands -of men during the Franco-Prussian war, if a single shot had not been fired, simply through ""the want of an efficient army service and medical corps, and proper arrangements for the health and comfort of the men. This is a matter to which we in Australia should give greater attention, and proper provision should be made for it in the Bill. The general principle which the Government appear to have kept in mind is, that the best way to prevent war is to be well armed. We are not to have a large permanent force, but there is to be large available reserves, which will give us an army, of about 50,000 men on a peace footing, and in time of war about 120,000 or 150,000 men, counting reserves. Such an army should be sufficient to make us feel secure, and enable us to go, on our way attending to our industrial wants, , developing the resources of the country, obtaining and preserving to ourselves the trade of the Pacific, and assisting the Empire, if not actively engaged in  iti  expansion. The various matters to which I have referred are matters which can be very well dealt with in committee. Above all things I desire the Government to realize the importance of providing an effective army service and medical corps, and of providing for every contingency of warfare, so that, although war must always be a painful and awful necessity, we shall be able to carry it on with as little loss of human life as possible. In the various speeches which have been made, various models have been ' held up to us of the type of soldier which we should endeavour to create, and various methods have been suggested for producing that type. But if we want the model of an ideal soldier, he is to be found in the army of the Roman Republic and of the Roman Empire. The legions of Caesar and Pompeius were composed of purely citizen soldiers, whose generals were men of skill, and who were able to control their men because of 4heir high moral integrity. There was no :gold lace and braid about Cincinnatus when he was' called from the plough to take charge of the Roman army. In that army the physical abilities of the soldiers were brought as nearly to perfection as they have ever been brought within the history of the world. I wish next to say a word or two as to the comparative merits of militia and volunteer forces. The three branches of our proposed defence force consist of regulars, militia, and volunteers. A good deal has been said in praise of the volunteer system, comparisons having been made favorable, to the volunteer as against the militia system, but I would like to point out that the volunteer system, unless carefully guarded, has' -certain dangers incidental to it which would become very grave menaces to any community. We know the tendency on the part of mankind, wherever we have gregarious humanity, to.collect themselves into various cliques and sets, and it is quite possible that very power- ; ful and numerous volunteer regiments might be got together that no working man could join. Thus we should have the classes pitted against the masses in the community. This  could not happen under a militia system. The partially-paid men would necessarily be drawn from the ranks of labour, and, consequently, the militia system offers a safer element for a defence force than the volunteer system which lends itself to class and caste' distinctions. I think there is some parity between the principle of the militia and the payment of members. The men who are able to stand the most hard work, who are capable of performing the longest forced marches, and who would be the best defenders of our hearths and homes, would not, owing to' their want of leisure and want of money, be able to enter a purely volunteer force, but, under a militia system, they would have every encouragement to come forward. I do not not oppose the volunteer system, but I think a militia force should be a very prominent and formidable part of the defences. A volunteer force might be the cheapest from an economical point of view, but in the main there is a kind of connexion in most people's minds between the cheap and nasty, and so the volunteer system might prove in the long run. If a thing is worth having it will be worth paying for.  I am not in favour of entirely superseding or extinguishing all the volunteers, because our rifle clubs :will be voluntary, and their unadorned uniforms will rid them of that element of danger that 1 specially fear in connexion with ornamental crack volunteer regiments. The plain unadorned rifleman will be a volunteer, and will not offer any encouragement to that 'class element .which will creep into any ordinary volunteer system. I hope to see the militia the strongest and most  important arm of our defence forces. Regular soldiers will, no doubt, be kept as a kind of standard and model which the other branches of ""the force will  approxi;mately  follow, and I hope that we shall have a large body of men drawing very near to their standard of excellence. 1 am very glad that there is no proposal in this Bill to herd men together in barracks. We know what the dangers of barrack life are in any community, and I am pleased that we are not to have that  to any  considerable extent here. I suppose honorable members know the danger of bringing men together in groups anywhere. Men will do things in mobs that they will npt do singly, and things which would be regarded as outrageous by the individual do not appear in the same light when men are acting together. The means to be devised for the mobilization of our forces is perhaps the most important matter to be considered in- connexion with our defences. It would surely lead to confusion worse confounded if our men were suddenly called out in a case of emergency, and the officers did not know where to find their men, whilst the men did not know .where to find their kits. We ought to have a recognised system of signals under which, at the first sound of the tocsin the men would betake themselves to the place where they could find their kits and their officers, and everything else that was requisite. This is one of the most essential things in connexion with any defence scheme, that is, to gather our men quickly together to enable them to meet the invading foe. Any one  who has read the poetry of  Sir Walter  Scott will remember the "" Fiery Cross,"" which was a primitive, but effectual, method of gathering the people together. On every hill the beacons blazed forth, and the men gathered together from all parts until they formed a solid force. Now, we have the telegraph and wireless telegraphy, and we should have a perfect system by which we could call our forces together quickly in the event of invasion. It is understood of course that our forces are purely defensive and that they would be mobilized for purely defensive purposes. If we make effective arrangements 'there will be no confusion, and we shall go a long way towards enabling our forces to repel any attempted invasion. It is right that we should remember that after  all an invasion is- a very remote possibility so far- as Australia is concerned. It would be about the most difficult thing in the world for any nation in Europe to land an army of more than 15,000 or 20,000 troops in Australia. Then Australia is blessed with one of the most inhospitable shores in the world, and unless the enemy were well provided for before he came, he would not be able to exist here. No doubt we shall have a force sufficient to repel any foe of that sort ; but let us not live in a fool's paradise, and believe that this can be done haphazard. We must have our army well in hand. An army is an organ of units under the command of one man - a vast machine which can be set into operation to serve the purposes for which it is called into existence. When we are deliberating what, is the best kind of machine we are studying it at rest, and my desire is that we may never see it at work. But, meanwhile, we have an opportunity of perfecting that machine, and one of the most importantmatters in that direction seems to be the devising of a proper scheme of mobilization. This will involve railway communication between the various centres that we may decide upon as rendezvous. Australia isfortunate in having no foreign element, among her neighbours. We are all of the one kith and kin. Perhaps one of the best models we could have in the formation of a new defence force would be the plan of Machiavelli, in Florence, during the middle ages. There the difficulty was that they had foreign neighbours all around, whom itwas dangerous to arm, even though they were allies. We have no fear of that, and we have simply to decide upon the various centres and to bring them into proper communication with each other by rail or by water, whichever may seem to be best. To sum matters up, I would remind honorablemembers of the great importance of givingan impetus to our defence movement by offering prizes, in the form of honours that would be coveted by our -young Australians in connexion with the performance of feats of arms at military tournaments. In practising for these, and by engaging in the various arts attached to military drill and training, ouryoung men would become fine specimens of humanity, which are never obsolete. Weshould pay attention to the formation of an army service -and medical corps, because many lives are lost for the want of adequate provision in this direction, and I hope that -some- amendment will be made to provide for this apparent defect in the Bill. So far as the main body of the defence force is concerned let us keep to the militia principle. The militia in the old country are certainly the least respectable of the various branches of the British army. But that bad odour does not cling to the militiamen in these colonies, and I want to see our militia playing a very prominent part, because I feel sure ""that if we want a good defence we must pay for it. By paying the men we shall . counteract the effects of that want of tenacity of purpose for which our young men are so conspicuous. ""Without payment they will start volunteering, and after two or three seasons' drill they will throw up the whole thing, but if the men are paid the position will be quite different. We should not pay our militiamen any extravagant rates, but we should give them sufficient remuneration for the time spent in drilling. If we take it for granted that people, will come forward to form our defence forces, we shall find that the whole movement will be confined to a few enthusiasts, who will work ardently for a few months, and then the whole movement will die out. If we have a militia force we may be perfectly sure that it will be drawn from those sections of the community which will furnish us with the best material, and there will be no fear of any class or caste distinctions which will be calculated to exclude the proper type of men from our lighting forces. Our militia will be composed of the men .who have formed the backbone of the English army in times gone by - men drawn from the peasantry, and from the horny - handed sons of toil, men who have toughness and endurance, men such .as those who went through the forced marches in the Crimea - the men who have really done the "" Deeds that won the Empire."" We want such men again, and if we have a purely volunteer system,- with the militia subordinate, I am afraid we shall not get the class we desire. These are the lines on which we should shape the Bill, which, I am perfectly sure, is quite capable of being moulded in that direction. I have no doubt it will come out of committee a much better Bill. This is really, an honest and faithful endeavour to give expression to the national policy of the country. It will give assurance to the citizens that we are perfectly safe against invasion, and will enable us to pursue -the national policy of developing the marvellous resources of Australia without interruption from a foreign foe.

. - I am not wholly impressed by the argument that everything is always opportune, which is what the speech to which we have just listened amounts to. Nor shall I follow my friend who has just sat down into the poetry of the situation. We must deal with the fair and reasonable aspect of it. I think there are difficulties  in  this matter. I pointed them out on a previous occasion, when a motion for adjournment was under discussion. Those difficulties would perhaps have been better met by the proposal suggested by the Attorney-General. No proposal was actually made, but there was a suggestion, and upon that it was thought it might be better to take further time for the consideration of this matter. However, I am quite content that a decision should be arrived at now. The honorable member for Maranoa always puts one in such a good humour that one feels rather a pleasure in saying that he is going to do something to meet him half-way. The honorable member for Wentworth made a very good and' reasonable speech, if I may venture with all respect to say so, and advanced arguments in that fair manner which always characterizes him.  In  point of fact he nearly convinced me in one part of his speech that this is not a question of a white Australia. But he has also gone far to convince me that a Bill containing such a provision as this is not one which we may anticipate will fail to receive the assent of the Crown. Notwithstanding that there may be difficulties founded on the distinction we have spoken of, I think that on the whole the difficulty in this proposal does not amount to one which is on the same footing with those we are trying to avoid in another Bill. I think that the question whether we shall allow, under certain circumstances, certain persons to land, is not the same question as whether we shall spend our money on one class of labour or another. The debate, however, and the speech of the honorable member for Wentworth. have gone far to make me think that we are not in such danger of a refusal of the assent to the Bill as I at one time thought we were. The honorable member for Wentworth asked why, if the Government did not approve of this amendment, they did not honestly dissent from it. But the Government showed in a prior discussion, to which I have referred, that they approved altogether of the principle of the amendment, and they say that now. ", 'Crown',POST AND TELEGRAPH BILL

- I think the Ministry stated a few days ago that they were prepared to put in force the inherent power which the Crown possesses to stop the immigration of aliens, pending the passage of legislation by this Parliament. It struck me at the time that that was a mistaken course. I do not think that any compulsion should be initiated by the Government, except on the authority of Parliament. When the great case of Ah Toy  v.  Musgrave was decided it was very clearly laid down in opposition to the preponderance of legal opinion, at all events, up to that point, that there is an inherent power in the Crown to prevent an alien from landing. That is to say, if an alien is stopped from landing, he has no right of action in British courts to enforce the payment of damages for trespass. At the same time, however, it was as clearly stated that for the Crown to exercise against friendly nations that latent prerogative would give a justifiable opening to international remonstrance. I therefore thought that a Government which is so careful about international complications that they actually take up an Immigration Restriction Bill which has been shelved at home, and  endeavour  to persuade Australia to pass it, should be  careful  to hearken to an expression from the judicial bench which fits in with Imperial authority as regards not angering the susceptibilities of other nations. I know  very  well what  Mr. Chamberlain  has in his l-jnd in regard to his desire that the colonies should have - although the Imperial Parliament may not pass it - an Immigration Restriction Bill. He clearly laid it down in a despatch which, I think, was sent in 1898 to the colonial Premiers, that what he was considering was the Japanese susceptibilities ; that Japan appeared to be, of all coloured nations, the one that was strongest and most friendly with the United Kingdom; and that it was, therefore, inexpedient that Australia should by any legislation offend, to use his own words, "" Japanese susceptibilites.""  There is no doubt that the ground of objection taken in England is that the principle of exclusion ought not to be based on colour. The right honorable  Mr. Chamberlain  expressly stated that in 1897, at the Premiers' Conference in London, and he somewhat softened the objections to coloured labour that were up to that time held by Australian Premiers. At the meeting that was held in Sydney in 1896, it was decided by the Premiers of the various colonies that the principle of the Chinese Restriction Acts should be applied to all coloured labour, and a Bill was introduced into the South Australian Parliament, and I believe into the New South Wales Parliament, extending the principle of the South Australian Chinese Restriction Act of 18S8 to all Asiatics, with very few exceptions. This Bill passed the South Australian Parliament, and I believe also the Parliament of New South Wales, but when it was sent home,  Mr. Chamberlain  withheld the recommendation to the Crown that assent should be granted pending the holding of the Premiers' Conference, and he subsequently got the Bill disallowed. He then explained to the Premiers that the natural desire of the Australians to exclude undesirable immigrants could be attained, as far as Asiatics were concerned, by adopting the principle of the Natal Bill, and he also stated at that meeting - apparently contradicting what was implied from his statements as regards the Asiatics, that the desire of Australia was to exclude colour - that the true principle of exclusion was not colour, which would affect 200,000,000 or 300,000,000 of  His  Majesty's subjects, but that the right of exclusion should be exercised where immigrants were dirty, or paupers, or immoral. It seemed to me when I read this speech of  Mr. Chamberlain's  to the Premiers, that it was about as egregious a piece of political cant as one could very well conceive. The idea that a man who was dirty should be excluded was absurd - as if a ship's bath could not cure him of any objections that might be urged against him on the ground of want of cleanliness. So far as men being paupers is concerned, we have to recollect that some of the best men - nien of enterprise, men of intelligence, men through whom the British Empire has become what it is - landed on these shores practically "" stone broke."" They were not what we know as paupers within the meaning of an Act of Parliament, but there were very few men who landed here, stirred by a desire to take part in the development of this' great country, who landed here with more than a few pounds in their pockets ; and are we going to leave it to some subordinate officer of the Executive to determine what degree of poverty shall afford justification for the  exclusion of an immigrant ? Then, so far as the ground of immorality is concerned, was there ever a greater piece of hypocrisy ? Is this immorality to be commercial immorality - and is this stipulation to come from a country which has recently passed through a series of commercial crises which have not been specially marked by any display of  commercial morality ? Or is it to be sexual immorality  1  Are we going to empower a police official or some other subordinate officer to examine all the women who come to our shores as to whether or not they have obeyed the mandates of the Gospel with regard to sexual purity ? Perhaps the provision is intended to be levelled at professionally immoral people - in fact, I think the Bill mentions prostitutes. But how on earth are we going to get perhaps some Pharisee of a policeman - or a Minister if you like - to differentiate between the relative degrees of morality or deviations from a correct line of conduct on the part of female. immigrants? It is not always the woman "" who minces ""virtue and does shake the head to hear of pleasure's name,"" but who, as' the poet  tells us, often "" goes to't with a more riotous appetite,"" who would be excluded by such legislation. But the unfortunate, who, perhaps, trusting too much to male honour, or who, being endowed by nature with a too great flush of womanly susceptibility has in a weak moment yielded to male importunity, and, without permanent blemish of mind, has sustained irreparable injury at the hands of man. To talk of making immorality a bar is to give utterance to a piece of nonsense, and to suggest something that is utterly impracticable, but which might, at the same time, have the effect of stopping a considerable number of intending immigrants from coming here. There is  no doubt that the matter that really affected  Mr. Chamberlain's  mind was the colour question, and that he contemplated our acting as a catspaw for him, because the Imperial Bill that was introduced in 1898 was not passed by the Imperial Parliament, but was opposed by some of the most powerful sections of the press as leading to nothing more, if I remember aright the words of the  Spectator,  than an additional staff of inspectors at various ports. Though this matter has been shelved at home,  Mr. Chamberlain,  having been in communication with the' Premiers of Australia previously, is now desirous that we should act as a kind of catspaw in reference to this matter. He does not wish to offend Japanese susceptibilities by raising the colour question. ; but the question is whether we are to subordinate our undoubted desire to prevent coloured immigrants from coming into Australia to the exigencies of Empire, as expressed by  Mr. Chamberlain.  This is a very big issue, but the question he has raised is whether our desire to make colour the basis of rejection shall be subordinated to the desire of the Imperial Parliament to consider the susceptibilities of the coloured races, and in the first place of that coloured race which is now armed to a point which entitles them to some consideration among the nations of the world. There is another reason which actuates some British statesmen in their desire not to offend Japan or even China. There is about ¬£300,000,000 of British capital invested in China. Two-thirds of the trade of the Yangtse-Kiang region belongs to England, and according to the statistics of 1896 about 80 per cent, of the trade of the river ports is English, and these are matters of course, which have very great weight with the Imperial authorities in considering the expediency of assenting to Australian legislation against the coloured races. I do not really think, however, that the Imperial Parliament will refuse to assent to any legislation that we may pass on this subject.  Mr. Chamberlain  never said that the final assent of the Crown would be withheld ; but he seems to have got over the Premiers, who were engaged in a round of festivities at the time of the Jubilee celebrations, and some of whom were knighted, or had other honours conferred upon them. At all events, the Premiers of the various States, who had decided to ' make colour the line of distinction, immediately backed down, and represented that the desire of the Australian States could be attained by the means suggested by  Mr. Chamberlain.  I cannot give the exact text of their minute on the subject, but that was its effect. I quite agree with those who say that wo ought to protect ourselves against an invasion of the lower races. I do not think there is much danger to be apprehended from this source just at present, notwithstanding the statistics of the last four or five years- which have been given by the Prime Minister. If we take the statistics from 1859 up to the present time we find that the number of Chinese within the Commonwealth has shrunk considerably in Victoria from about 44,000 to 12,000, and that during the whole period the numbers have been gradually declining. In 1888 the s.s.  Afghan  came to our shores with 268 Chinamen on board, and it was owing to the refusal to land in Victoria about 60 Chinamen on board who were in excess of the statutory number allowed to be carried by the steamer that the celebrated case of Ah Toy  versus  Musgrave arose. The people of Australia were' then frightened that we were going to be overwhelmed with Chinese, but the  experience  during the last 50 years has shown that these aliens have always come here in flushes and the true statistics of the increase or decrease of these races amongst us are to be found in a comparison of succeeding periods of ten years. To take the figures of any period for five years would be quite misleading, as it will be found that by taking the period from 1885 to 1890, there was an excess of immigration into New South Wales, whilst in the following five years up to 1895 there was an excess of emigration over immigration. On the whole, the -number of Chinese amongst us is gradually  declining,  and I do not believe there are 12,000 in the whole of the States as against 45,000 in 1859. In South Australia there are not 200 Chinese.

-I could not help thinking in listening to this debate how very quickly public opinion has advanced upon this subject within the last few years. I have just been thinking that it was within these very walls that the late Professor Pearson uttered those words of warning, that were hardly regarded at the time, but which he afterwards reiterated in his very interesting work,  Rational Life and Character,  which have attracted the attention of statesmen in all parts of the world. I have a vote for the district which  my  honorable friend, the last  speaker,  represents, and perhaps it is appropriate that, following upon his heels, I should indicate that I am watching him. The honorable member puts his points clearly, honestly, and straightforwardly, and no man can mistake what he means. If Australia has any national question, this is it. 1 recollect a passage from Froude's  Oceana,  of which I was reminded when I heard the eloquent speech of the honorable member for Maranoa. I looked it up, and I find that Froude prophesied that, because Australia has no national question, we shall have no men of first-class distinction. He says - 
 
Wo have our national concerns to look after and our national risks to run, and therefore our thoughts and anxieties are enlarged. They have none of those interests; their situation does not allow it. They will have good lawyers among them, good doctors, good men of science, engineers, merchants, manufacturers, as the Romans had in the decline of the Empire. But of the heroic type of man, of whom poets will sing and after ages be anxious to read, there will not be so many, when the generation is gone which was born and bred in the old world. Such men are not wanted, and would have no work cut out for them. 
 
The speech of the honorable member for Maranoa, has convinced me that there is still room for great and heroic characters within the bounds of Australia. I sincerely hope that as he has been in the old country, and has been convinced by his experience here of the need there is for legislation of this character, he will be able to transmit to his descendants to all generations the importance of keeping Australia for the white people. I hope that no. attempt will be 14 a 2 made to make party capital out of this matter. There have been some indications in that direction. I am proud to see that all parts of the House seem to concur in the view that we should try to keep this continent, which is almost the only temperate part of the world that is available for settlement, exclusively for the white races. The Government are to be congratulated upon their promptitude in bringing forward this measure. Though I differ from them as to the particular means to be adopted  for accomplishing our object, I must say that they have acted in a laudable manner in endeavouring to lessen the difficulties which confront the Home authorities in the settlement of this important question. The Home authorities have their difficulties. I am quite sure that no honorable member wishes to increase them. At the same time, looking ahead, I do think that we shall create more difficulties not only for ourselves, but for the Imperial authorities, if these undesirable immigrants once get a footing in large numbers within our bound? aries, than if we keep them without our boundaries.

Britain in her hour pf need and trouble.

I do not think that the magnitude of this question is well understood in the old country, or that  Mr. Chamberlain,  although he has been so ably advised upon it, understands it as we do. He does not know the temptations which Chinese and Japanese have to come here. The great mass of the English people have no interest in the question at all, and if we voice the feeling of Australia in such a way that it will be impossible for. the people of England to misunderstand it - if we give good reasons for the faith that is in us - we shall, by this debate and the comments which will take place upon it, so instruct them that their future Ministers, who will have to decide finally upon legislation of this sort, will not be able to withstand our wishes. We have had kings in England who were statesmen, and statesmen of the British race who were kings. The greatest men in English history were men who would not have thought twice as to how to deal with this question. In England they are celebrating - and I think it is a pity that we have not had a similar celebration here - the millenary of Alfred the Great. He was an ideal Englishman, and if the question could have arisen in his day, or if he had lived in our day, it is evident in what way he would have dealt with it. How would Queen Elizabeth have dealt with such a question had she had a dependency like Australia? How would such men as Pitt, who hailed with satisfaction the American revolution when he knew the gross facts of the case, have dealt with it  1  How would men like Rhodes deal with it  1  The giving of annoyance to Chinamen, the irritation of the Japanese, the coming into conflict with the Indian subjects of His Majesty would have been difficulties which would have been brushed aside by such rulers as unworthy to weigh in the scale with the hopes and fears of Australia at the present moment. But in what way ' do the Ministers of the Commonwealth propose to deal with the problem ? They have brought- down a measure the fourth clause of which provides that no one shall be allowed to enter the Commonwealth unless he can write 50 words in the English language.  I  thought at one time that Ministers were acting under secret instructions from the Colonial-office in this matter; but, when the egregious folly of this test is considered, one is forced to admit that that cannot be so. Many persons of Japanese, Chinese, and other races whom we desire to exclude, can read and write English far better than the natives of friendly European powers who are desirable immigrants. Such a clause as this - as I pointed out to the Prime Minister when he introduced the Bill - would exclude French Canadians, and he said, in answer to my interjection, that he would deal with that matter directly. I have not seen that he has dealt with it in any way. A clause like this- would have prohibited my fellow-countryman - if I may be allowed to call him so - the honorable member foi* West Sydney, had it been in operation when he arrived in this country at nine years of age, and when he could not speak or write a word of English. A clause such as this would prohibit the natives of the Channel Islands, the Gaelic inhabitants of the North of Scotland, and many other very desirable immigrants. But it would not prohibit many undesirable immigrants, the exclusion of whom is the very object of the Bill. Japanese could come and go through the test, and the Chinese, knowing of the test would work up their knowledge and be prepared to pass it. Hindoos will do the same, and the answer to all this by the Prime Minister, so far as he has given an answer, has been a sort of- enigmatic assertion, "" We can provide for all this ; you must trust the  administration.""  In other words the proposals of the Minister have no principle, and all we have to depend on is the administration of the law by the officers of the Government. What will that amount to  1  How is the Act to be administered  1  When a Japanese presents himself to a landing waiter,' has the visitor to be reported to the superior officer as a. man speaking very good commercial English, but as a man who is an undesirable immigrant on account of his race ? Is that the way in which this Act is to be administered  1  Is it to be that the superior officer will say - "" Oh, give him schedule 4,"" ordering him to write some 50 words of Johnsonian English containing the peculiar old Latin derivations into which the doctor was so famous for turning his thoughts - a task which would at once floor the Japanese, and cause him to be sent away ? On the other hand, if a desirable German immigrant approaches the same officer, has he, though possessed perhaps of no more English than would enable him to say "" good-day,'""' to be treated under schedule 16, and asked to write out 50 words from the Child's First Reader, and before he has settled whether "" dog "" is spelt with a "" t "" or a "" d,"" to be admitted as a desirable immigrant? The Prime Minister has admitted that he is not committed to this proposal altogether - that it is not a vital principle of the Bill, but that he is willing to make the test a European language. If a Japanese can speak and write English and French well, willhe have prescribed some antique Spanish diction, or 50 words, from some Florentine poet? Is a German who comes here to be allowed to pass in his own language, while we stop the Japanese who can speak French ? If that is the intention I hope the committee will pause before we commit ourselves to such a piece of deceitful legislation, wanting in principle and in everything that ought to commend it to honorable members. We have no right to look at the consequences of passing this measure with the amendment of which the honorable member for Bland has given notice. If we think that the amendment is the light way of obtaining that which we all wish to obtain, and we think that that which we wish to obtain is absolutely necessary for Australia, we must leave the responsibility of vetoing this measure with  His  Majesty's Ministers at home. I do not myself fear that the Bill will be vetoed. I am willing to admit that in the first instance it may probably be vetoed ; but I am perfectly certain that if the same measure ispresented again, some solution of the difficulty will then be found, if it has not been found in the interim between the Bill being first vetoed and its second presentation.

- That is so. If, instead of working in the heat of the day, those engagedin the industry were to adopt the system in force in some parts of Europe, and work in the cool of the morning and the evening, they would avoid the great heat which is supposed to bethe chief objection to the employment of white men in these localities. Having regard to the assistance which it is going to receive from  the  Commonwealth Parliament, there is no reason whatever why this industry should be destroyed because of the abolition of kanaka labour. I am sure we are going to give it that assistance, and that theindustry will survive the passing of this measure. There is no country which does not possess some territory which cannot be utilized. I have no desire to see the sugar industry of Queensland injured, but, if it came to be a question between its abolition and its perpetuation at the cost of. a white Australia, I should say - ""Away with the industry, even if it represents seventy millions instead of seven millions of capital."" Every country has its deserts, its mountain ranges, and its swamps, and if any portion of Queensland territory is found to be unfit for occupation by white races let it remain as it is. That is the position I take up, for the poet's lines are as true to-day as when they were written - 
 
Illl fares the land, to hastening ills a prey, Where wealth accumulates, and men decay. 
 
If we admit races to our country which will contaminate the blood that has peopled the world, which has come forth from the northern parts of Europe, andfrom Great Britain particularly, to cultivate and gladden the waste places of the earth - if we allow any deterioration in that blood - then, I say that, even though wealth may accumulate, our race may well decay.

- I offer no excuse or apology for doing so, because, this is one of the most important questions that can claim the attention of the Federal Parliament, and but for the question of free-trade and protection arising, and the fact that I,, as a free-trader, strong in that belief, desire  to have a free-trade policy adopted by the people of Australia, I would not be a- member of this House to-day, because. I' should not have bothered about standing for a constituency. I went because I believe that free-trade is inseparable from the prosperity of the Commonwealth, and as a native of Australia I felt it my duty - a feeling which I am sure that other honorable members share - to do the best I could to further the interests of the Commonwealth. I, therefore, fought one of the hardest, battles that was fought in any of the States. I did not engage in any light fight ; I did not go to a constituency which, was known to be a strong free-trade constituency. I was asked to contest several easy constituencies, but I preferred to go to a constituency which was virtually in the hands of the protectionists, and which isrepresented in the State Parliament to-day by the Treasurer, the Minister  for Lands, and two other honorable members; all four of whom are strong protectionists. They did all they could to assist the candidate who was opposing me, : but I am glad to say that I was able to defeat them, and that the constituencies which they represent, instead of returning a majority of 700 or 800 votes in favour of protection, as had previously been the case, gave me a majority of about 600, showing the remarkable change that was taking place. I admit that in New South Wales the majority has always been in favour of free-trade. We have never had. protection there by the will of the people. It is true that we have had two doses of it, but that is because of the treachery of their representatives. Whenever the people have had an opportunity of speaking through the ballot-boxes they have punished those who were traitors to the country, and in most cases relegated them to private life. I understand that before this debate is concluded the House will be given a little information as to the results of freetrade and protection in other countries. One honorable member said last night that he would give us some statistics, but I shall anticipate him by giving him a few to which he will have an opportunity to reply. I have taken occasion to refer with sorrow to the unfortunate condition of the workers of Victoria. That condition has been brought about by the failure of many of their public men, and of a certain journal in this city, to put full and correct information in regard to the results of the fiscal policy in other countries before them. I cannot wonder at them being misled, under such circumstances'. An honorable and learned member, for whom I have the greatest respect, who occupies a high position in this House, and has been AttorneyGeneral to the State of Victoria - a man who has given considerable attention to political questions - interjected the other evening, when the leader of the Opposition was speaking - "" What about the ' Song of the Shirt ' ? "" The honorable and learned member seemed to believe that that poem was written at a time when England had free-trade; but it is wellknown that it was written by Hood in 1844, when the people had been suffering from protection for many years.

- Before reading Hood's poem, which caused such a stir in England at the time it was first published, I will read an extract from a description of the condition of the workers of England in 1844, written by Engels :  - 
 
Women and men enfeebled, children deformed, limbs crushed, whole generations wrecked, affected with disease and infirmity, purely to fill the purses of the manufacturers. Children seized naked in bed by the overlookers, and driven with blows and kicks to the factory, their clothing over their arms ; how their sleepiness is driven off with blows ; how they fall asleep over their work ; children too tired to go home hide away in the wool in the drying-room to sleep there, and could only be driven out of the factory with straps ; how many hundreds came home so tired every night that they could eat  no  supper for sleepiness and want of appetite, and their parents found them kneeling by the bedside, where they had fallen asleep during their prayers ; how the mother goes to the mill shortly after five in the morning, and comes home at eight at night, and is obliged to give drugs to the small children to keep them still till she returns. How the tender frame of a child is least able to withstand the unfavorable influences of an inferior lot in life. The neglect to which they are subjected when both parents work, or one is dead, avenges itself promptly, and no one need wonder that in Manchester, according to the report last quoted, more than  57  per cent. of the children- boys and girls - of the working classes perish before the fifth year."" 
 
That was the condition of the workers of England when the ""Song of the Shirt"" was published. 
 
Mr.Ronald.  -  And to-day 
 
- I shall come to that presently. The lines which I ""wish to quoteare these :  - 
 
Oh men ! with sisters dear ! 
 
O men with mothers and wives! 
 
It is not linen you're wearing out, 
 
But human creatures' lives.

A shroud as well as a shirt.

- We will take it at that - that transportation involves waste, and that what is required is the development of the home market. If transportation involves waste, is not that protection for the home market ? If so very much is lost to those people who are transporting goods from one part of the world to another, surely that is an argument rather in favour of free-trade than of protection. We here in Australia have a natural protection sufficient for all practical purposes, and any interference in the way of artificial protection attracts the people from those natural developments that mean prosperity for this or any other country. I now come to the consideration of this question more particularly in regard to the workers. In this respect, my opinion is that if protection had been called by its true name, we should have heard very little of it in Victoria at all. In spite of what the great poet said about a rose by any other name smelling as sweet, there is agreat deal indeed in a name. The old lady who. read her Bible, and told her parson that she derived so very much comfort and consolation from ""that blessed word Mesopotamia,"" was in somewhat the same position as many workers in Victoria in regard to the comfort they derive from the equally blessed word, protection. The proper name for this policy is trade restriction. "," 'Victoria', 'Victoria'",MOTION OF CENSURE

- I presume that the calculations made by the Minister for Trade and Customs are correct ; I have not challenged them. ""We are not in the position of experts who can challenge these figures, and for the purposes of controversy we have accepted them. We suppose that the Tariff will raise the revenue that is expected from it ; but it has been argued that if a revenue Tariff, which would not be designed to protect various industries, were introduced, it would lead to desolation in Victoria, that factories would be shut up, and vested interests would be interfered with.

           Factory Times, for November 22nd, 1895, entitled ""Our Trade: a serious question for consideration.""  Mr. Mawdsley,  the secretary of the Amalgamated Associations of Cotton Spinners, says - ""Much as we deplore the fact, there can be no question that the countries of Eastern Asia are more and more preparing themselves for an onslaught on the cotton trade. We .are not going to moralise on the fact that the great bulk of the cotton machiney  at present being made is for export, though that is a matter which might well be considered...... Our export trade is, and must remain, the backbone of our business, and it is consequently abroad that we shall have to look for any relief worth having."" 
 
What does  Mr. Clarke  say ? - 
 
The foreign markets from which  Mr. Mawdsley  hopes so much are already being opened up by others. The Egyptian Cotton Company is building at Cairo ; and "" many persons are watching the inception of this enterprise with eagerness as to other ventures to follow."" While spindles in Lancashire have only increased by 50,000 in three years, those in other parts of the world have increased over 3,500,000 in the same time. Of this increase, over 1,000,000 is in India, China, and Japan. 
 
I should like honorable members opposite, and the members of the labour party, whose sympathies in this direction are identical with my own, to note that it is the workers of India, China, and Japan who are cutting down the wages of the English workers to-day. 
 
In India, the increase in spindles and looms during the last fifteen years has been 270 per cent. ; increase of hands, 300 per cent. ; increase of cotton consumed, 425 per cent. ; and while in Lancashire, mills were standing idle and thousands of operatives out of work, thirteen new mills were in course of erection in India. 
 
Does that not appeal to my honorable friends ? Does it not show them that the admission of foreign goods without restraint is depriving the English operative of his living, and, indeed, of his life? Time will not permit me to read more, but it is a matter to which my honorable friends must give the most earnest consideration. During the speech of the leader of the Opposition, I ventured to make an interjection, which has been the subject of some comment in this Chamber and out of it, when I said that it was in England that "" The Song of the Shirt "" was written. My right honorable friend said, at a later stage, that it had probably not occurred to me that that poem was written in the deepest and darkest protectionist times. Do honorable members know what the terrible duty on cotton was in England when that poem was written ? Do they know that the duty upon manufactured calico was 10 per cent., and upon calico goods 20 per cent.

- That is a contention with which I am rather inclined to disagree. As a ruleI do not find the  Argus  unfair, and I have no reason to say anything against it in that respect. At the same time, for that journal to quote, as it did on Tuesday last, from reports relative to the sweating prevalent in New York, without on the other hand drawing attention to the sweating that exists in England, savours of unfairness from a political standpoint. I admit - as every sane man must admit - that sweating exists, in default of legislation, both in free-trade and protectionist countries. So far as the ""Song of the Shirt"" is concerned, the lesson which that poem conveys is quite as true of England to-day as it was 40 or 50 years ago. Indeed, the condition of affairs is even worse at the present time.

Neither do I think that any one who has listened during the past fortnight to all that has been said - chiefly, I must confess, by honorable members on the other side of the House - will deny that full advantage has been taken of the variety of subjects offered to us. I must also do those honorable members on the other side of the House the justice of sayin g that they have not confined themselves to the wide range of subjects offered for discussion, but have expatiated freely upon everything connected with what has come before us. In this debate we have seen a literal fulfilment of the poet's injunction - 
 
Let observation with expansive view,

Certainly every authority which treats of the conditions and resources of the various peoples of the world, from China to Peru, has been ransacked in order to provide material either in support of, or in contradiction to, the statements which have been put forward from time to time during the debate.

         Mr. Isaacs. - I did not quote Professor Davidson on that point ; I quoted him from page 84. 
 

         Mr. GLYNN. - But the honorable and learned member quoted Professor Davidson, and he will pardon me for controverting him out of the mouth of one of his own authorities. 
 

         Mr. Bruce Smith. - It is the same Davidson, I suppose? 
 

         Mr. GLYNN. - It is the same Davidson, and the same book. 
 

         Mr. Isaacs. - I said distinctly that Professor Davidson was a free-trader. 
 

         Mr. GLYNN.- No doubt ; but as the honorable and learned member quoted this authority, he will pardon me for adopting what I consider proper tactics, and putting beyond cavil the weight of my authorities by adopting his own. The honorable and learned member cannot challenge, as authorities, the authorities he quoted ; and I am entitled to point to their conclusions. Considering these facts, I cannot understand the position taken up by a political philosopher like the honorable member for Darling, who, while lamenting the inequalities of present social adjustments, declines to ameliorate because he cannot altogether cure - who will do nothing because hecannot do everything - helps to perpetuate the admitted evils of protection, because he fails to find a panacea in free-trade - who prefers to sit still and await the millenium, rather than, in the interval, try to lighten the load of human misery. I cannot understand why men like him, who wish for generations to come to smoke the pipe of self-complacency in peace, do not stick to the study, which is the proper place for philosophers, rather than seek the representation of men in Parliament, which is the arena of action. I can quite as well understand as the honorable member, that free-trade is not the last step in social progress. 
 

         Mr. Mauger. - Is it the first?

- I saw the figures, either in the  New York Journal  or the  New York World  - I forget which - and the statement is perfectly true. Every enlightened Englishmen who goes to America goes back to his own country and says that English manufacturers must adopt American methods. English papers and magazines are full of leading articles about 
 
American progress. The curse of it is that for ages in England the leading men did not believe in free education. They believed in keeping the mass of the people ignorant. They thought that 50,000 ignorant men, with one educated man to look after them, could run a country. But they have found out now that education is a physical, as well as an intellectual, force, and that, while every American is able to work his feet and his hands with his head, the average man in an English factory works his head with his hands and his feet ! Consequently English manufacturers only get about half the amount of product out of their workmen that the American manufacturer gets. In other words, 20,000 men in America produce more than 30,000 in England. That is what is driving England out of the manufacturing centres of the world. I venture to prophesy to-night that within ten years we shall see the policy of protection adopted in England. Unless a country adopts protection she cannot get reciprocity with any other country. She has nothing to give. Other countries take her markets from her. The United States has the English markets, and is swamping them with American products. In conclusion, let me say that I hope that the Minister for Trade and Customs will adopt a policy that will give to those men in New South ""Wales who have been struggling for years a little protection at once. I hope that he will not only agree to give a bonus, but that he will finish up by moving for a duty of 15 per cent.; and that this country will gradually arrive at the point that is admirably summed up in the lines of the greatest poet of democracy, Robert Burns -

             Mr. CONROY (Werriwa).- I wonder that honorable members opposite do not claim that a duty on oysters is important for the sake of encouraging the manufacture of wire netting because wire netting if of sufficiently small mesh would keep off the fish that prey upon the oysters' spawn ! It is ludicrous that we should be asked to retrace our steps on a matter of this sort. If Ministers intend to conduct the business in this fashion, I may as well inform them that I am going to remain here for the rest of the year. 
 
I am inclined to think that the Opposition have been too peaceful altogether. When I look back upon our lost opportunities,  I realize that it is simply and solely because we had not wearied out the Government supporters that they are behaving as they are now doing. When we were discussing coffee berries we learned from the honorable member for Mernda that the duty was levied on the berry with the skin on, and he pointed out 'how absurd it was to do that, because people do not consume the skins. But we are now asked to levy a duty of 2s. per cwt. on oysters in the shell. I do not know precisely what is the weight of the oyster apart from the shell. Probably there would be about 10 lbs. of oysters to every 100 lbs. of shell. The tax on the oysters, apart from the shells, would be something like 20s. on every cwt. of oysters eaten. Do the Government intend to allow a drawback on the shells  1  Probably if honorable members opposite advertised the fact that there is to be a duty of 2s. per cwt. on oysters, the New Zealand oysters will learn to grow with less shell ; though from the oyster's point of view they should grow more shell, so as to have a better chance of not being exported and devoured. I have no doubt that at Stewart Island, whence the bulk of the oysters come, the decision of the Federal Parliament will be largely advertised, and that we shall have an oyster parliament passing a vote of thanks to this Chamber. The local oysters would of course view the matter differently, and point out how the duty will increase their chance of dying. I cannot but be surprised at the action of two or three representatives of Queensland in this matter. Sometimes honorable members think it proper to represent the views of their constituencies without pledging themselves to those views ; but if they do so, they should not call on honorable members on this side of the House to vote with them. There must have been a solemn Cabinet meeting since the item was struck out at the instance of the Prime Minister himself some months ago, and I should very much like to know the name of the wise Minister who suggested that this item should be reinstated with a view of preventing the eating of New Zealand oysters. Consider, too, what earnest debates must have taken place in order to overrule the original decision of the Prime Minister. How did the Cabinet divide? The poem of ""The 
 
Walrus and the Carpenter"" must be entirely unknown to them. Such a proposal turns our proceedings into a farce, and one would have thought, even from the point of view of the Government, that the item would have been laughed out of the Chamber, seeing that it is proposed to impose only1d. per lb. on tinned fish, while about 2s. per lb. is imposed upon the raw material. For the sake of revenue to the amount of about ¬£270 extra Customs officials will have to be engaged. I am sorry that honorable members who previously agreed to strike out this item should now, for party purposes, support the present proposal.

- I think that the public who have watched the mysterious evolutions of this Tariff will feel some astonishment, and indulge in some speculation, as to the extraordinary developments which have led Ministers who profess to be so desperately anxious to close the session, and who speak so frequently as to the imperative necessity of removing from the mercantile and industrial communities the uncertainties connected with the discussion of these duties, to regard this item of salt as of sufficient importance to justify a course of action which I most strongly condemn. There are a thousand reasons bearing upon the merits of the case why this matter should have been allowed to rest ; but the fact that any Government which really wishes to expedite business should throw down this bone of contention at the present most inconvenient time suggests a number of interesting speculations. ""What is the particular charm that surrounds the interests of those people who manufacture salt in Australia ? Why should their claims be advanced, whilst piteous appeals from a large number of industries engaged in a bitter struggle for existence are absolutely unheeded and treated with contempt ? The salt industry already enjoys an enormous protection in the cost of bringing the commodity from distant countries to the Commonwealth, and in addition to that the protection granted by the present duty is higher onthead  valorem  scale than that accorded to almost any other industry in Australia. Yet the Government have brought up this bone of contention again, and after a decision has been arrived at by a majority of six they are making a desperate struggle to add another 10 or 15 per cent, to the 30 or 40 per cent, protection already granted. The Treasurer for a moment won my sympathy by the candid revelation he made that this increase was really being proposed to the pain, and contrary to the delicacy of feeling of the Minister for Trade and Customs. This revelation made us almost feel prepared to add another ¬£1 per ton to the duty, but my feelings were slightly cooled when I referred to the printed schedule, and found that this paragon of delicacy had placed the proposal for an increase of duty under his own name. What sort of farce is this ? One Minister proposes this duty, and states that it is being brought forward contrary to the delicate feelings of his friend and colleague, and then we find that this same friend and colleague had associated his own name with the proposal before the face of the whole world. Why this explanation? What apology is necessary for the Minister for Trade and Customs? He is not a shareholder in the salt company ; he has no personal interest in the matter. We know that he is incapable of any dishonorable act. Then why this reference to delicacy of feeling on his part, except it be intended as an appeal to the weak generosity of honorable members? It is most unfair to appeal to the sympathies of this committee by putting the somewhat rough-and-ready Minister for Trade and Customs under a glass case, as one of those delicate, intellectual entities, who shudder at the slightest risk of misconstruction. To be suspected of having even a kindly feeling for a South Australian industry is an imputation which fills the delicate sensibilities of my somewhat retiring friend with horror.When we find that this item of salt draws from our matter-of-fact friend, the Treasurer - whose somewhat limited range is atoned for by his thoroughly honorable and candid treatment of all matters so that he always commands our respect - this poetic attitude of admiration for his delicate friend and colleague beside him, we really want to know what sort of rehearsals have led up to this marvellous performance before the public of Australia. How many wires were pulled, how many pulses felt, before the Government which talked about recommitting the item of tea, could muster courage enough to throw overboard their delicate feelings and susceptibilities in order to -make this blunt proposal? They weregoing to recommit the- item of tea, they said, because it was one which affected the revenue of the Commonwealth, and even the solvency of the States. But when the wires were pulled and the pulses were  felt,  this heroic Government, which need have no delicacy upon' the subject of Chinese tea, found that a certain section of the committee would take it as an exceedingly offensive proceeding if they endeavoured to obtain ¬£300,000 01 400,000 of revenue from a duty upon that article. The moment they discovered this, their courage shrank from the ordeal, and as a result we hear no more about the proposal to include tea in the list of recommittals. The desirableness of preserving the solvency of the States could not inspire them with sufficient courage to bring the item of tea before us for reconsideration, but the desperate zeal of the honorable member for South Australia,  Mr. Batchelor,  has been able to induce them to adopt that course in regard to salt. If the Government wished to choose an item which brought before the minds and consciences of the people of Australia the horrid selfishness underlying so many of these proposals they could not have chosen- a better one than this. I say nothing about the fact that salt is one of the essentials to human life and health. But I ask those guardians, who are so keen to look after the interests of this or that little knot pf people in the Commonwealth, to consider for a moment the interests of the great majority. While it is easy for the honorable and learned member who spoke a moment or two a,go to work out ingenious calculations as to how much per cwt. this or that duty will place upon the energies of our struggling population, and to indulge in correct little addresses to this select audience, I ask honorable members to recollect that the people to whom he refers have a sufficiently hard task to preserve their solvency in the bitter struggle against the unchecked competition of the whole world. Surely some of our sympathy and care should be directed towards making the burdens upon things- which are so vitally necessary in the industrial operations of this country as light as possible. Whilst men who have never studied the result of keen  competition in the markets of the world can speak so lightly about adding this or that trifle per cwt. to any particular ' article, do we not know that out of the tiny difference between the price of a- commodity in one country and its cost in another, developments of. commerce have occurred, which in the course of time represented large sources of wealth to one country at the expense of great distress in another ? Do we  not know that many of the gigantic industrial developments which, to- clay, excite our admiration had for the secret of their greatness the smallest beginnings ? Let us show some of our charity and consideration to those who bea.r the heat and burden of the day. When we talk of the keenness of competition, which is felt here in respect of the productions of distant lands, can we forget that our own settlers, afflicted by drought and a thousand, calamities, have to send their products across the seas, to face the bitterest competition from all the white and coloured nations of the world ? Cannot the current of  our sympathies turn away from this or that little spot of self-interest, from this or that whining appeal for more charity, toconsider the state of the people upon whom the prosperity of this country really depends ? If some concession is to be made at the last moment, cannot we make it in the interests of the great primary industries ? I do not ask honorable members who have so loyally supported these high duties forany generosity, but I do say that if there is to be any sympathy hawked about this chamber, we should give the great Australian industries the benefit of it. Let the heart and the mind which can be excited by the contemplation of a cry from a salt-pan in South Australia listen to the voice of the tens of thousands ofpeople who are laying the foundations of Australian, greatness all over this continent. After the monstrous production which the Ministry laid upon the table of this House in the shape of a Tariff which night after night was torn to shreds, one would have thought that they had been humiliated sufficiently and had learned enough to prevent them from again challenging the conscience and independence of men who sit here, and who - are determined, whether in a majority or a minority, that the great interests of this country shall be recognised. If we cannot win we are determined that all the secret machinations which go on shall see the light of day. When week after week we have heard the wails of every industry in Melbourne, when we have seen the interests 'Of South Australian  manufactures loyally championed by their representatives, when we have beheld the large industries of States not so near to the centre of our deliberations treated by the Government with ignorance and contempt, we begin to regret that a stalwart champion like  the Minister for Trade and 'Customs does not represent in the Cabinet the interests of New  South  Wales. . If New South Wales had had the good fortune to be represented in the Government by the Minister for Trade and Customs, we should have been spared some extraordinary revelations of absolute ignorance in regard to some of the largest industries upon this continent. I do not wish my remarks to acquire any unfriendly tinge. I cannot help feeling a sort of sneaking sympathy with honorable mem bers who do their best for the industries of the particular State which they represent. I see in that no sign of turpitude, but I do say that the pioneers of Queensland and New South Wales, who .are the future backbone of the Australian nation, and who are working out the rough and difficult problems of colonization under the most arduous conditions, are entitled to some slight consideration. It is a small matter, but, as has been said, the great interests of humanity are all small. The daily struggle of every family settled on. our wide lands is small, insignificant, and a somewhat repulsive spectacle ; but out 'Of the energies and strife of these people must come the future greatness of Australia. I can quite understand that honorable members, hardened by what they have come to know of the various contra.vances used to excite the sympathy of this Chamber, become somewhat cynical when any reference is made to the interests of the great body of the people. At election time these interests are the most congenial theme of all politicans. How touching is the solicitude of the  candidate for the welfare of the farmer, the miner, the dairy-farmer, and the selector? But when he comes into this chamber, where the convictions and the desires of the great body of the people should be crystallized into good laws, there seems to be a somewhat different atmosphere, and the solicitude of the candidate disappears under the pressure of private interests. Some gentlemen, who before their constituents are full of the most sublime generalities, are quite a pattern of cynical indifference in this chamber. 
 
Their sensibilities can be inflamed only by the question of taxing -butter-box timber, or some other contemptible trifle. Surely, now that we are approaching the end of our task, we might leave buried the conflicts .of the past. Have the Ministry not had enough experience in dealing with this Tariff that they court another series -of defeats and humiliations ? Is there not a point at which their appetite will be sated, and, with a chastened and better informed mind, they will settle down to the business before them? Are they still in that frame of mind .that they undertake chivalrous adventures at this unseasonable time  1  Have the people engaged in the salt industry presented any pitiable petition ito the House 1 If so, it has been addressed to some quarter in which it has not met the public eye. So far as we simpletons know, those engaged in the industry have been absolutely contented with the decision of the committee. When was the vote on this item arrived at ?

- Had that been so, the excessive duty on timber would have been commented on  but the Minister for Home Affairs was silent on the matter. In any case, with a duty of ls. 6d. per 100 super, feet, the duty cannot exceed 4d. on the 17ft. or 18ft of wood which is used. A machine such as that outside could not be put upon the market under ¬£15. It is an admirable piece of work, but it is not the machine which the poor widow or the seamstress buys ; it could serve as an article of furniture in any house. The brasswork on it is worth more than in most cases, and the duty on it would thus be more. But the brass-work on an ordinary machine is of the very cheapest kind, and I should be very sorry to say that I could not open the locks with a hairpin. The duty on the whole brass-work would not amount to more than 3d. or  3¬Ωd.  Therefore, the statement made by the Minister for Home Affairs that the duty on the raw material for cheap machines stands amounts to 2s. 6d., while that on the dearer class of machines is os., is difficult to understand. The difference between the clearer and the cheaper machine-stands, so far as the duty on the material is concerned, is that on the better class of machine, polish instead of varnish is used, and electro-plated instead of brass or some other cheap fittings are put on. Certainly at the outside the difference in the duty could not be more than ls. on the two classes of machines, even if everything were used on them as stated by the 
 
Minister. I still maintain that the estimate made by me last night was based on a close examination of sewing machines, and I have confirmed it this morning by a further examination of a machine manufactured by the same firm. The remarks made by the honorable member for Southern Melbourne have for the most part no connexion with the subject, but where they have they are so outrageously  wrong  that they do not call for further comment. The honorable member urged that machines would be dearer now, but that by-and-by the widow - if she lived - would be able to secure them at cheaper prices. Just imagine the honorable member for Melbourne Ports as a widow, plunged in unutterable grief at the death of the bread-winner, and confronted with the irrefragable fact that the price of sewing machines is ¬£10 10s. ; but that the protectionist manufacturer proposed by-and-by to reduce them to ¬£5. If he could be a widow, I think he would be as good a one as ever lived ; but in such circumstances even he would rather get married again than wait for such a condition of tilings. We know that the effect of this taxation is to increase the cost of these articles. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports spoke like a poet on the effect of taxing articles from which varnish is made. He urged that the result would be that varnish would flow through the land like cataracts of wild honey and milk, but the Minister for Home Affairs says that position has not yet been reached. We have the statement on the one hand that protection increases the cost of the stand, while the Minister for Home Affairs says that it decreases the cost in the case of the machine itself. In America, where they have had protection for a very long time, the retail price of a Singer's sewing machine is ¬£1 dearer than it was under free-trade in New South 'Wales. America is the home of the sewing machine, but the selling price there has never decreased ; so that we might have a widow of 40 years ago, long since in her tomb, still waiting for the everlasting trumpet call announcing cheap sewing machines. The request made by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports is outrageous, while the support afforded to him by the Minister for Home Affairs is characteristic of the honorable gentleman. The whole request is so astounding that if it were made to a body of men who were unaccustomed to such unreasonable demands it would meet with a very short shrift. In this committee, where it is unnecessary to consider the reason that underlies anything, but necessary only to consider the numbers one has at his back, there is something to be said in its favour. Although a number of employes of the firm in question are among my constituents, I must vote for what I believe to be the best interests of the Commonwealth. In deciding upon that course I am cheered by the knowledge that for the last five years those men have lived under a system of perfect free-trade ; while the proprietor of the manufactory has been able to build up a colossal industry and make a huge fortune. Now he says tha't a duty of from 4d. to ls. on a machine-stand is going to crush his industry out of existence. I refuse to believe it, and I challenge the honorable member for Melbourne Ports and the Minister for Home Affairs to substantiate their statements on any platform in any State they please. They have not a leg to stand on ; and, what is more, they know it. ","Southern Melbourne', 'America', 'Singer', 'New South', 'America'",TARIFF

- Thanks to the builders of the Constitution, our task in dealing with this Bill is very plain, because if we are to have a uniform franchise for the Commonwealth, we must have adult suffrage. That is provided for in the Constitution. Unlike the right honorable member for Tasmania, and the honorable member for New England, I speak with some little practical experience of the old and the new order of things. When in 1896 the South Australian Legislature discussed the question of whether or not the franchise should be extended to women, we heard objections similar to those which are now being raised. We heard talk about the undesirability of bringing woman down from her pedestal to mix up hi the hurly-burly of politics. We were told that female suffrage would be demoralizing to women. But as you know,  Mr. Speaker,  we have had three elections in South Australia at which women have had the right to vote, and I desire to-night to testify briefly to the great improvement which has taken place in political matters generally, and especially in political meetings since the advent of woman into politics in South Australia. Political meetings there are conducted now far better than they were before womanhood suffrage was granted. We do not see any of that rowdy element which, acording  to the newspapers, ' is often associated with political meetings in Victoria. I have no hesitation in saying that since the advent of womanhood suffrage in South Australia there have been mixed audiences at political meetings, similar to those which .assemble to hear lectures, and no man need be ashamed of his wife or child attending these meetings. On election day we see no rowdy element, and I hold that womanhood suffrage in South Australia has improved the whole tone of politics there. If one were to ask those who opposed it bitterly in that State - conscientiously believing that it was going to be a very bad thing- whether any of the baneful results which they anticipated had taken place, they would answer candidly, "" No."" They would say also that even if they had the power to take away the franchise from the women of South Australia they would not desire to do so. I have no fear as to the result of passing this measure. I am certain that after womanhood suffrage has been given a few years trial the two honorable members who have just spoken will be well satisfied ""with it. I do not think it is necessary to speak at length upon this subject. It has ray hearty support, and in the words of the poet, I would say to the right honorable member for Tasmania, and the honorable member for New England -

- I desire to bring under the notice of the Government a matter of considerable importance to a large number of persons in the employ of the Commonwealth. When the Defence Estimates were being discussed a number of honorable members urged that unless they had some control over the proposed economies, those in the lowest grades of the military service would be the first to suffer. I am sorry to say that the economies are working in that direction. A number of men in the Naval department have received notice that after the 30th June their services will be no longer required. These notices appear to have been issued quite irrespective of the time men have been in the service, or whether they are married or single. Not only are married men being discharged simply on the ground that their time has expired, but also men who have volunteered and served in China. These latter men were absent in China when they should have been resworn, and because they were not here they are receiving no consideration. The Minister for Defence ought to look into this matter, and I am sure he will have sympathy not only with the married men, but with those who have served the Empire abroad. It has been urged here and on the public platforms - we have even called poets to our assistance to. strengthen the opinion - that the men who have risked theirlives for the Empire should have their positions kept open for them. It has been urged that the Empire is under a debt of gratitude to them. ","China', 'China', 'Defence'",Discharge of Naval Employ√©s

- Butif honorablemembers arelikely to be actuated by such feelings, that is a strong reason why another tribunal should be provided. I hope the committee will follow the lines adopted by the House of Commons. If the present system in England had been found excessively expensive, doubtless some honorable member of the House of Commons would have taken action, but we find not a whisper of discontent. As to our being a new Parliament, it is better to act on the precedent of an old Parliament rather than incur the risk of scandals. I shall vote for the retention of the clause. 
 

           Mr. L. E. GROOM (Darling Downs).I intend to support the provisions of this Bill for the purpose of having election petitions tried by a court. My reason is that I do not think that this House is in any sense fitted to be a judicial body. In out Constitution a distinction, which we should strictly observe, is drawn between judicial and legislative functions ; and if the House is to try election petitions, it must assume to itself functions which are strictly judicial. Another reason why I think we should have a court constituted as provided for in the Bill - with certain modifications which I will afterwards mention - is that this court is to try election petitions for the whole of Australia. Honorable members must not forget that if these petitions were tried by an elections and qualifications committee, it would be absolutely necessary to have all the witnesses brought to Melbourne, or wherever the seat of government might be, for the purpose of having the matter adjudicated upon. This would be especially inconvenient and expensive in the case of such States as Western Australia and Queensland. It is not an uncommon thing, when there is a big election petition to be tried, for there to be 30 or 40 witnesses. I can mention a case where there were between 40 and 50 witnesses. It would be impossible to bring so great a number of witnesses from the remotest parts of Australia to the seat of government for the purpose of examining them. Such a thing would not be necessary in the case of a court of disputed returns, as provided for in the Bill, because the measure enables arrangements to be made for relegating the issue to be tried to the State courts. The provision to which I allude enables an application to be made for what is poetically known as a change of venue, so that the case may be heard where the witnesses reside.

  Sir John  See know sis to whether the Parliament of New South Wales will approve of the establishment of a State iron industry ? I admit that I. have never argued altogether in favour of State socialism. Many honorable members have supported a movement like this, sometimes as the lesser of two evils. If it requires such an enormous capital as the Minister urges it does, the manufacture of iron must, in the very nature of things, be a monopoly. The supply of ore is limited, as he urges, and there are only one or two beds that can be opened. Under these circumstances, although perhaps not under others, there are honorable members on this side who will turn round and say - "" Much as we are in favour of private enterprise, if we allowed this business to be held entirely by private individuals, it would be encouraging monopoly - it would be giving a grant to special individuals which they did not deserve."" As the honorable and learned member for Corio very truly pointedout, we must not forget that iron is used by men in at least twenty trades, while only one is engaged in its production. The right honorable member has stated that 4,000 men may possibly bo engaged in the iron industry in time to come. That is the utmost estimate which even the Minister has dared to offer. We know his power of imagination. We know exactly how much reliance to place on his figures. We on this side have examined them too often not to feel perfectly sure that he possesses on certain subjects connected with figures an imagination which might be the envy of many poets; and even he put down the number of employes at not more than 4,000. Is he aware that in the various trades in Australia there are at least 70,000 or 80,000 men for whom iron is the raw material? Yet he not only asks us to support his proposal, but he has the assurance to say that afterwards we must continue a protective duty of 10 per cent. He does not say to us - "" This is ah industry which, as soon as it is started, will bo like many others. It will become selfsupporting."" No ; so far from that being the case, by giving this bonus we shall encourage another parasite to spring upone which we must always support, because it will never be able to stand without assistance.
